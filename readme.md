Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.js` (Entrypoint file)
   - `expressApp` function: Creates and configures the Express application.
   - `startServer` function: Starts the server and listens for incoming requests.

2. `routes.js`
   - `postReplData` function: Handles the POST request to write the JSON object to a file and respond with an empty object.
   - `getReplData` function: Handles the GET request to retrieve the JSON file.

3. `fileUtils.js`
   - `writeToFile` function: Writes the JSON object to a file.
   - `readFile` function: Reads the JSON file.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

`app.js`
